\title{Phase Class for Multi-Wave Sampling Organization}
\description{
\pkg{optimall} defines three S4 classes for organizing the
multi-wave sampling workflow: \code{Wave}, \code{Phase},
and \code{Multiwave}.
An object of class \code{Multiwave} holds metadata and a list of objects of
class \code{Phase}, which in turn holds metadata and a list of
objects of class
\code{Wave}. These three object classes are used together to organize the
workflow of multi-wave sampling designs.

\item{\code{waves}}{A list of objects of class \code{Wave}, each element
representing one wave of the phase}
